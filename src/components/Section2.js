                            Hello, I am Gamze, I am a 3rd year high school student.
                            From the time I started high school, I decided that I was
                            a versatile person, because I like to gain knowledge by doing
                            research on all kinds of fields. One of these areas was web
                            software. After my teacher noticed me after the 10-week training
                            I received through the private teaching institution of the city
                            I live in, I entered the Capsule technology platform voluntarily
                            to improve myself, and I am still learning new things here as a volunteer.
